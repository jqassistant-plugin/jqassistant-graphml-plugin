= jQAssistant GraphML Plugin

This is the http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/[GraphML^] Plugin of https://jqassistant.org[jQAssistant^].
It enables jQAssistant to generate GraphML XML files for result data of concepts.
Those files can be used with several graph rendering
and analytics tools like http://www.yworks.com/en/products/yfiles/yed/[yEd^] and http://gephi.org[Gephi^].

For more information on jQAssistant see https://jqassistant.org[^].

== Using the jqassistant-graphml-plugin

NOTE:: Starting from jqassistant-graphml-plugin v2.0.0, the GraphML-Plugin resides under jqassistant-plugin.
Therefore, not only the repository location changed but also group id and artifact id were adapted from `com.buschmais.jqassistant.plugin:graphml` to `org.jqassistant.plugin:jqassistant-graphml-plugin`.

NOTE:: From jQAssistant v2.0.0 onwards, it is not part of the core distribution anymore and a manual configuration as shown below is required.
